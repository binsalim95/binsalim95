ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Usama. 

  I'm a current Master's student in Computer Science with a passion for Data Science and ML as well as teaching it. In my repository, you can find some of my data science projects that
  I've worked on in a number of fields including Health Care, Finance, Sports Analytics, and Image Recognition. You can also find a few snippets of past lessons that I've done in 
  Data Science and ML.
  
  I enjoy constantly learning new things in coding and am always looking for ways in which to improve. On top of having a proficient understanding of algorithm design and database management, 
  I also have knowledge on regression analysis, KNN, SVM, Sequential/Residual neural nets, Naive Bayes & Random Forrest. While I am a huge Python buff, I am also proficient with Java,
  R, SAS and SQL. 
  
  In my free time, I enjoy Reading, Biking, Powerlifting, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and binging as much Netflix as I can.
  
  I'm currently interested in taking on Freelance Projects, internship work in Data Science/Ml as well as Teaching Programming to all skill levels. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to email me at usamab95@gmail.com
