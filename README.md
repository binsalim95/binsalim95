ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Usama. 
  I'm a data scientist turned data/software engineer with a passion for building data pipelines and teaching all things data. In my repository, you can find some of my pet projects in data as well as a few snippets of past lessons that I've done in 
  Data Science and ML.
  
  I enjoy constantly learning new things in coding and am always looking for ways in which to improve. On top of having a proficient understanding of algorithm design and database management, 
  I also have knowledge on regression analysis, KNN, SVM, Sequential/Residual neural nets, Naive Bayes & Random Forrest. While I am a huge Python buff, I am also proficient with Java and SQL. 
  
  In my free time, I enjoy Reading, Biking, Powerlifting, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and binging as much Netflix as I can.
  
If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to email me at usamab95@gmail.com
